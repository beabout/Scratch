# Scratch
A record review site (Letterbox but for albums)

**run dev env**
```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
(without `0.0.0.0:8000`, we cannot access the dev environment from another PC on the network)

## Data

How will we obtain data to populate our database? From Spotify! 

Users can log into their Spotify accounts which will then provide us with access to album data, which we'll use to build up the Scratch Database. 

## Reviews

Reviews will be able to have sound snippets.
